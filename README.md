# Vulture-Tracking-System-using-ESP32-

The system uses an ESP32 board, which controls the GPS module and processes tracking data. TheESP32 is energy-efficient and allows wireless communication, making it ideal for long-termmonitoring. Additionally, the project includes a Morse code feature, which can send simple codedmessages using LED signals or radio transmission. This can be useful for alerts or low-powercommunication in remote areas.
The goal is to design a tracking system that works for a long time without frequent battery changes.The dart includes a lightweight GPS, an ESP32 Microcontroller, and a small solar panel to keep it

charged. Tests show that this system can track vultures accurately and for long periods, making ituseful for conservation efforts.
